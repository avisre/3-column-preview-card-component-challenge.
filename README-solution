## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

 I learnt about line-height property and how to aggregate padding in a single line as opposed to adding them individually. I also noticed that i wasnt fullfilling the project requirements after my first pass. So i went back and compared the live site to mine and ironed that out.
 I learnt that it is very important to review your code to check whether it is as close to the requirements of the project.








### Useful resources

- [MDN WEB DOCS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) - This helped me to style the border radius as per requirements.
